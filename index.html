      This specification describes a programming interface to [the Web of Things](http://w3c.github.io/wot/current-practices/wot-practices.html) (<dfn>WoT</dfn>), that allows scripts run on a <a>Thing</a> to discover and access other <a>Thing</a>s through a Client API, provide resources characterized by properties, actions and events through a Server API, and access locally attached hardware through a Physical API.

    Implementers need to be aware that this specification is considered unstable. Vendors interested in implementing this specification before it eventually reaches the Candidate Recommendation phase should subscribe to the [repository](https://github.com/w3c/wot-scripting-api) and take part in the discussions.
